## ADUL
What is ADUL? Now ADUL is just a compilation of some small utilities written by me or taken from other places. In theory they can be useful in any project

# Latest stable version: 0.1.0

# Main points

Main points:
1. This library name stands by Alivka's Different Utilities Library.
2. This library is compilation of some utilities
3. This library also contains tinyxml2 c++ library source files
4. These utilities aren't really well written but may be useful in some scenarios

# Utilities

Utilities:
1. tinyxml2 library source files for working with .xml format files
2. logs module that provides interface for printing logs to any output stream
3. time module for time managing and measuring
4. exceptions module which is compilation of some maybe useful exceptions classes
5. BitVector class


# Notes

Notes:
1. tinyxml2 is not my library, but I find it very useful!
I put it here cause it is compact and i would like to keep it in easy access

# Documentation

The documentation was generated via doxygen tool and [Doxygen-Awesome theme](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css.git)

Documentation can be found in docs/html/index.

In documentation you can see also private and protected attributes and methods because I think that user should know more about how API he uses work under the hood and with such additional information it can be easier to understand the API functionulity 

I didn't want to add Doxygen-Awesome as dependency so just putted all necessary files into the doxytheme folder

# To-do and plans

To-do and plans:

# Possible plans

Possible plans:
1. Adding implementations of some algorithms and data structures
(only possible plan because some of them are already implemented in STL)
2. Creating tests for the project
(small chance that i will do it because i am just the definition of word laziness)

# ADUL
What is ADUL? Now ADUL is just a compilation of some small utilities written by me or taken from other places. In theory they can be useful in any project

# Latest stable version: ???

# Main points

Main points:
1. This library name stands by Alivka's Different Utilities Library.
2. This library is compilation of some utilities
3. This library also contains tinyxml2 c++ library source files
4. These utilities aren't really well written but may be useful in some scenarios

# Utilities

Utilities:
1. tinyxml2 library source files for working with .xml format files
2. logger utility that provides convenient interface for printing logs to any output stream
3. time utility for time managing and measuring
4. compilation of some maybe useful exceptions classes


# Notes

Notes:
1. tinyxml2 is not my library, but I find it very useful!
    I put it here cause it is compact and i would like to keep it in easy access
2. It's better to include only "include/ADUL.hpp" header to get access to the api
3. Time utility is wrapper for STL steady_clock

# Documentation

To get documentation you need to open docs/html/index.html or index.html soft link via your browser

# To-do and plans

To-do and plans:
1. Creating documentation for the project via dox++ tool

# Possible plans

Possible plans:
1. Adding implementations of some algorithms and data structures
(only possible plan because some of them are already implemented in STL)
2. Creating tests for the project
(small chance that i will do it because i am just the definition of word laziness)

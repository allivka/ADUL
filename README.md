# ADUL
Main points:

1. This library name stands by Alivka's Different Utilities Library.
2. This library is compilation of some utilities
3. This library also contains tinyxml2 c++ library source files
4. These utilities aren't really well written but may be useful in some scenarios
5. List of working utilities:
    1) tinyxml2 library source files for working with .xml format files
    2) logger utility that provide convenient interface for printing logs to any output stream
    3) time utility for time managing and measuring
    4) compilation of some maybe useful exceptions classes
  
Notes:

1. tinyxml2 is not my library, but I find it very useful!
    I put it here cause it is compact and i would like to keep it in easy access
    
2. exceptions classes inherit from std::exception STL class
